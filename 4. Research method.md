## 4. Research method

The chosen method for conducting this study was the action research method due to its characteristics. Action research aims to provide research subjects, participants, and researchers with a response to the problems they face in a more effective and transformative action-based way. It facilitates participants to find solutions to problems, an aspect that conventional research has achieved little [33]. 

According to Coughlan and Coghlan (2002), action research has three main phases [33]:
-	Preliminary Phase (called pre-step): which comprises the understanding of the context in which the study will be conducted, as well as the purpose of performing the work;
-	Execution Phase (called main steps): this phase can be represented by six steps of Data Gathering, Data Feedback, Data Analysis, Action Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation;
-	Monitoring Phase (called meta-step): this phase is a continuous activity that includes verifying each of the six previous steps to identify the learning generated in the conduct of the action research.

This research is structured as shown in **Fig. 1.** The study began with a Preliminary Phase to understand the context and then followed by two Execution cycles composed of the following steps: data analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The duration of each cycle was linked to the annual management cycle of the company involved in the research, which provides for the planning of goals and actions for the following year, as will be detailed later. Each cycle was conducted with one objective, as presented below:
-	**1st Cycle**: the first cycle aimed to define and implement a model for TDM in PHP source code development, which includes TD identification, monitoring, and payment. The TDM source code process should be able to identify potential events that could affect the maintenance and evolution of the software and allow the TDM to be compatible with the amount of debt that the organization was willing to accept;
-	**2nd Cycle**: the second cycle was a revision of the previous cycle, in which, besides implementing and evolving the TDM process, the prioritization of the source code was defined.

At the end of each cycle, the results were used to review and evolve the TDM process. Each cycle followed the phases suggested by [39] but was tailored to be executed in 4 steps:
-	**Data analysis**: This step comprises Data Gathering, Data Feedback, and Data Analysis suggested by [33]. The collection and analysis of the information was carried out through meetings between the researcher and the groups of professionals responsible for several areas of the company and by the analysis of the tools that the company had or that could be used in this project. Duration of four months in the 1st cycle and two months in the 2nd cycle;
-	**Action planning**: In this planning step, actions and deadlines were presented and discussed with those involved in the project. The stakeholders approved the activities before proceeding to the next step. Duration of two months per cycle;
-	**Implementation**: In the implementation step, the planned actions were carried out. At this point, the prioritization and payment were done to change the current TD situation. Some of the TD payment actions had an execution period of up to one year. Duration of twelve months per cycle;
-	**Evaluation**: The evaluation step of the cycle is the key to reflect on the results and build knowledge, aiming at the improvements for the next cycle. In this phase, the results of the actions and the periodic monitoring were evaluated during TDM. Duration of four months in the 1st cycle and ten months in the 2nd cycle.
