# Managing Technical Debt in action: Process, Strategies and Tools
by Thober Detofeno, PhD
## Abstract
<b>Context:</b> Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor that expresses the immaturity of software artifacts and their impacts on maintenance activities and product evolution. As organizations become able to identify and understand the effects of TD, challenges arise when making investment decisions to pay it off. Although several theoretical and practical studies have been developed recently, studies that adapt the context and stakeholders objectives for TD Management (TDM) are still lacking.

<b>Objective:</b> This paper aims to present an incremental and evolutionary TDM process, as well as strategies and tools. At each new iteration, or cycle, the results are evaluated, the objectives and the teams' capacity are reviewed to evolve in the TDM goal. The approach can be implemented as a whole or in parts, depending on the context and the goals of the organization.

<b>Method:</b> This research was developed using the action research method. Two cycles were carried out in partnership with a software development company over almost three years. The duration of each cycle was linked to the annual management cycle of the company involved in the research, which provides for the planning of goals and actions for the following year.

<b>Results:</b> As a result, a TDM process was proposed and validated. We found evidence that the defined process improved internal software quality with an annual decrease of ~65% in the most critical TD and a ~30% decrease in the average number of bugs identified per customer, leading to software product quality improvement.

<b>Conclusion:</b> The research presents a proposal for TDM with empirical evidence of use in the software industry. The process is detailed, as is the building path, the results are analyzed, and the decision-making processes are documented. This experience can help other software development companies in implementing TDM.

## Summary


[1. Introduction](https://github.com/ThoberDetofeno/Managing-Technical-Debt-in-action/blob/main/1.%20Introduction.md): This text introduce the critical challenge of Technical Debt Management (TDM) in software development. It proposes the implementation of an incremental and evolutionary process, validated in a real industrial context, to effectively manage Technical Debt. The proposed approach aims to provide a practical solution for organizations seeking to mitigate the negative impacts of TD and improve their software development practices.

[2. Background](https://github.com/ThoberDetofeno/Managing-Technical-Debt-in-action/blob/main/2.%20Background.md): This chapter explores the Conceptual Model for Technical Debt, including its properties, causes, consequences, and costs, while discussing the challenges and importance of TDM in software development projects, emphasizing the need for a systematic approach to identify, measure, and address TD to improve software quality and maintenance.

[3. Related Work](https://github.com/ThoberDetofeno/Managing-Technical-Debt-in-action/blob/main/3.%20Related%20Work.md): The purpose of this text is to provide a literature review of related work in the field of TDM, summarizing key studies, frameworks, and findings from various researchers to establish context for further research in this area.

[4. Research method](https://github.com/ThoberDetofeno/Managing-Technical-Debt-in-action/blob/main/4.%20Research%20method.md): Describes the context and method used to conduct this study.

[5. Context and Purpose](https://github.com/ThoberDetofeno/Managing-Technical-Debt-in-action/blob/main/5.%20Context%20and%20Purpose.md): Understanding of the context in which the study was conducted, as well as the purpose of performing the work.

[6. First Cycle](https://github.com/ThoberDetofeno/Managing-Technical-Debt-in-action/blob/main/6.%20Action%20Research%20First%20Cycle.md): The first cycle aimed to define and implement a model for TDM, which includes TD identification, monitoring, and payment.

[7. Second Cycle](https://github.com/ThoberDetofeno/Managing-Technical-Debt-in-action/blob/main/7.%20Action%20Research%20Second%20Cycle.md): The second cycle was a revision of the previous cycle, in which, besides implementing and evolving the TDM process, the prioritization of the source code was defined.

[8. Technical Debt Management Proposal](https://github.com/ThoberDetofeno/Managing-Technical-Debt-in-action/blob/main/8.%20TD%20Management%20Proposal.md): This section compiles our proposal for the TDM process and some strategies and tools resulting from the two action research cycles conducted over more than three years.
