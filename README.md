# Managing technical debt in action: Process, Strategies and Tools

## Abstract
Context: Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor that expresses the immaturity of software artifacts and their impacts on maintenance activities and product evolution. As organizations become able to identify and understand the effects of TD, challenges arise when making investment decisions to pay it off. Although several theoretical and practical studies have been developed recently, studies that adapt the context and stakeholders objectives for TD Management (TDM) are still lacking.

Objective: This paper aims to present an incremental and evolutionary TDM process, as well as strategies and tools. At each new iteration, or cycle, the results are evaluated, the objectives and the teams' capacity are reviewed to evolve in the TDM goal. The approach can be implemented as a whole or in parts, depending on the context and the goals of the organization.

Method: This research was developed using the action research method. Two cycles were carried out in partnership with a software development company over almost three years. The duration of each cycle was linked to the annual management cycle of the company involved in the research, which provides for the planning of goals and actions for the following year.

Results: As a result, a TDM process was proposed and validated. We found evidence that the defined process improved internal software quality with an annual decrease of ~65% in the most critical TD and a ~30% decrease in the average number of bugs identified per customer, leading to software product quality improvement.

Conclusion: The research presents a proposal for TDM with empirical evidence of use in the software industry. The process is detailed, as is the building path, the results are analyzed, and the decision-making processes are documented. This experience can help other software development companies in implementing TDM.
