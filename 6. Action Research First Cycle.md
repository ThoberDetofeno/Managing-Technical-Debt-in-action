## 6. Action Research First Cycle

This work started from of TDM approachs proposed by Seaman and Guo (2011) [16], adding the experiences reported in the works of Oliveira et al. (2015) [20] and the seminar of Dagstuhl (2016) [6]. From these three research, it was defined the activities of TD Identification, TD Measurement, and TD Monitoring how the base to start a TDM.

The studies by Guo, Spínola, and Seaman (2016) [20] and Fairley and Willshire (2017) [40] showed solutions to manage TD from a risk management point of view. Inspired by risk management, this study identified the need understanding deep of TD before de activity TD Identification, to meet this need added the activity TD Analysis

According to Holvitie et al. (2018) [21], involving stakeholders deeply and establishing clear and permanent communication is necessary. In this project, such practice helped in the sponsorship and dissemination of the company.

This cycle challenge was to implement the concepts of TD and TDM, once the company did not have had any similar project before. In the Evaluation stage, several results of this cycle are described, highlighting the development of the TDM Process as the most important result for the continuity of the project in the company.

### 6.1. Data analysis

This stage was characterized by creating the TD Guild, the conception of tools, the definitions of quality rules, and the decisions to guide and support TDM. Once the company did not have any history of TD projects, aligning the concepts and expectations was necessary.

The TD Guild was responsible for collecting and analyzing the data, defining the necessary tools, and approving the project stages with the stakeholders. Data was collected through observations, interviews, and a static source code analysis tool. SonarQube plus the SonarPHP plugin tools supported data collection and static analysis for the PHP source code. It was necessary to adapt the tools to the product architecture. The TD Guild selected the tools and identified such modifications.

According to the guidance of Fernández-Sánchez et al. (2015) [24], even using automated tools to manage TD, the opinions of people who know the system deeply are needed. Expert opinions about the software provide information that is difficult to obtain from static source code analysis.

After the TD Guild creation and the tools definition, the following activities were performed:
-	Priority analysis of the quality rules
-	Definition of the principal value of the TD
-	TD Measurement

#### 6.1.1. Priority analysis

The negative impact of violating quality rules may vary across rules or even across contexts. Thus, developers cannot effectively manage TD without context-specific validation and prioritization of quality rules. Not all rules have the same importance, and the importance may even vary across contexts. Thus, another practical problem in using tools to manage TD is that quality rules are not validated and prioritized according to the application context [29]. The SonarPHP plugin provided 127 quality rules, **91** were chosen to be monitored, classified into Blocker, Critical, Major, and Minor. 

In the priority analysis, these quality rules were classified considering the objectives and the available resources. This analysis was used to prioritize TD payment actions. Following these guidelines, the TD priority analysis was carried out collaboratively between the researcher and the TD Guild members. Such, a new concept of each quality rule with the list of options for defining the priority was describe, below the description to guide the classification of the rules, and a summary of the number of quality rules per priority:
-	**Blocker (24 rules)**: Rule considered as a bug, system vulnerability, or command that should not be used;
-	**Critical (26 rules)**: Important rule with high impact on product quality and source code standardization;
-	**Major (14 rules)**: A minor rule with a low impact on product quality;
-	**Minor (27 rules)**: Good practice rule that should be monitored;

#### 6.1.2. TD principal value

The principal value of the debt refers to the cost to eliminate a TDI. Depending on the type of TD, this can be translated into different activities, such as updating outdated documentation, refactoring hard-to-maintain source code, or defining new test cases to improve their coverage [16].

In this work, it was defined that the cost to eliminate a TD is equal to the effort necessary to solve all items of the TD. The effort required to solve each TDI is needed to evaluate the feasibility of the TD payment actions. In SonarQube, it is possible to define the effort required to solve each item. Its configuration has suggested values for the effort to correct each of the quality rules violations. However, by performing a more detailed analysis, it was found that the effort values suggested by SonarQube did not reflect the reality of the context. 

To help calculate the effort required for TD payment, we proposed to analyze each quality rule under two dimensions: complexity and impact. We have defined complexity as the technical difficulty to solve a quality rule. We have defined impact as the extent of the change within the system, that is, what is the change potential to affect other modules or classes. The effort (in minutes) to solve each quality rule was estimated using a pilot project to measure some TD samples. 

#### 6.1.3. TD Measurement

TD measurement is performed to assist in decision-making and define actions for TD control, elimination, or reduction. In this procedure for measuring the TD, we tried to estimate and measure the TD from the priority settings and the parameters defined to calculate the main value of the TD.

When running SonarQube in PHP source code, a total of ***587,347*** items was extracted from TD. The number of TDIs grouped by priority: 
-	**Blocker**: ***8,993*** TDI; 
-	**Critical**: ***37,441*** TDI; 
-	**Major**: ***476,572*** TDI; 
-	**Minor**: ***64,341*** TDI. 

The most significant quantity of TDIs was classified with Major priority. This difference between the number of TDIs among the priorities was due to the formatting rules of the source code.

In this research cycle, the Software Development area was divided into 11 teams. Each team analyzed the number of TDIs and efforts. Fig. 3. presents the effort required for the Blocker type for each group. The possibility of all teams eliminating the Blocker type TDIs during the action period was identified. Team T01 had the most TDIs, estimated in 54.24 development hours to eliminate all the items of Blocker type. This was approximate twice the time of the T02 team, which is the second with the most significant amount of TDIs. In the middle of the graph, we have T03, T04, T05, and T07 with ~20 hours and the other teams below 7 hours of estimate.
 
Fig. 3. TD Blocker item quantity and effort per team.

Doing the same analysis for the Critical and Major priority TDs, most teams did not have enough resources to eliminate these TDIs during the project period. The main difference in the amount of TD among the groups is due to the amount of source code each one is responsible for. Thus, the more source code the team is responsible for, the more TDIs and the greater the effort required.

### 6.2 Action planning
The action planning stage was carried out by joining the teams and the TD Guild. At this stage the deadlines and goals for executing the actions were established. From the results of the previous stages, it was possible to obtain the subsidies for the payment of the TD. Based on the results of the TD measurements, analyzed by the TD Guild, the following actions were planned:
	Prepare and follow up the goals per team for the elimination of the TD;
	Perform internal training on the best practices of PHP development and suggestions on how to refactor the source code to eliminate the TDIs;
	Publicize the project and the target of each team by the board of directors.
This definition was based on Letouzey and Ilkiewicz (2012) [28] work. The authors recommended defining standard monitoring indicators for the entire organization, creating dashboards to facilitate communication and transparency, and setting aside time to train teams.
The team's goals to decrease the TD in the first cycle were elaborated from the analysis of priority and effort to eliminate an item of TD. To reinforce the strategic guidelines defined, this communication was carried out by the Director of the area. This was particularly relevant once it showed the sponsorship for the entire organization.
The company did not have documentation on development standards and best practices, so it was necessary to implement these standards and communicate to the teams. The internal training for developers sought to provide knowledge and communicate about changes in the procedures for developing the PHP source code. 

### 6.3. Implementation
Each action was unfolded into tasks and decisions to carry out the TD payment, considering the teams' constraints of time and resources.
#### 6.3.1. Action 1: Develop and monitor the goals for TD payment
This action was divided into developing and monitoring goals. The following guidelines were determined at the goal development stage:
1.	All quality rules with Blocker priority must be eliminated.
2.	The cost of eliminating all Critical priority quality rules can generate an overload in some teams.Then, 70% of quality rules with Critical priority must be eliminated. 
3.	Each team is responsible for its TD and should not use shared resources from other teams.
4.	Guidelines 1 and 2 are the teams' goals for the payment of the TD corresponding to the period of one year.
5.	The goals to eliminate TD are part of the company's results participation program. 
A website with the current TD results and the goals was made available for follow-up purposes. The results were grouped by team, priority, and exception rules. All developers have access to this website and were able to follow the progress in achieving their goals. 
According to the study by Oliveira et al. (2015) [20], the effort to manage TD can reach 25% of total development time. In this cycle, the efforts to pay for the TD were sized empirically, but each team should have more than 20% of its time to pay for the most critical TDs.
#### 6.3.2. Action 2: Train the development team
The training was conducted to qualify and guide developers on changes in PHP programming procedures and the release of source code in PHP, aiming to meet the goals of the teams and the company's objective. The training was held at the beginning of the first cycle in two classes, training 24 developers. The training was 4 hours long. Each class had at least one developer from each team. The developers who attended the training were responsible for passing on the knowledge to their teammates. The training was documented and published in the organization's internal knowledge base tools.
#### 6.3.3. Action 3: Communicate the project
This action's objective was to disseminate the PHP source code TDM project to all Software Development professionals. The communication was made at the beginning of the first cycle by the area director. During this event, the importance of the project was explained, the team's goals for the period and the starting date for TD monitoring were communicated. This action aimed to highlight the project's importance for all developers as an area initiative to improve quality and productivity in software development. Having the director lead this communication was crucial to the project's success.

### 6.4 Evaluation
The TD Guild establishment helped disseminate the project within the company and identified the appropriate TD aligned with the company's objectives. Communication took place at all stages of the project so that all project implementers and stakeholders understood the rationale and reasons on which decisions were made. Communication was mainly through TD Guild meetings, follow-up meetings with team leaders and their formalization, and by e-mail or documentation in the knowledge base.
The tools used were fundamental to give visibility to the TD. SonarQube provided a standardized prioritization of quality rules. However, it was necessary to develop a context-specific priority categorization.The direct involvement of TD Guild members in categorizing and classifying the quality rules improved confidence in the study and the use of the tools. The TD Guild generated stakeholders confidencebecause decisions were made between an experienced group and the board of directors. In practice, it is not possible to claim that the classification of quality rules is accurate. Still, by aligning the rules classification with the company's goals, the teams were motivated to achieve the goal.In the priority analysis stage and calculating the TD principal value, the understanding of the TDs within the context of the study was sought. One of the essential outcomes of these analyses was understanding the impact of the TD within the context. By analyzing in detail all the rules and their priorities, complexities, impacts, and efforts required, it was possible to build an information base to support decision-making in TD prioritization and payment.In the TD measurement or TD evaluation, the information was used in the decision-making process of which TD needs actions and initiatives for payment. At this moment, the company gained visibility of the TD in the source code.
The decision of the goals to be part of the company's bonus program contributed for the teams to include the TD payment in the sprints planning. This decision, along with the announcement made by the director, showed to all those involved the importance of the project within the Software Development area. These actions had a positive impact on this project.
Table 3 presents the measurements of the KPIs used to evaluate the results of this study. The measurement was performed by product version, from version 8 to 11. Versions 1 to 7 are displayed in the table for longitudinal perspective purposes. As can be seen, the KPIs did not present significant differences in the results. By analyzing the KPIs, it was not possible to isolate the effect obtained from this research cycle.
The number of customers represents the total number of active contracts the company has. It was not possible to identify the number of actual users due to how the company sells the product. The company has several contracts, and the largest customers have a contract for unlimited users, so it is complex to precise the number of individual users.
The analyzing the results by priority shows that within the four versions this cycle we had a decrease of 61.94% of the total TDI being: 64.53% with Blocker priority; 34.36% with Critical priority; 70.82% with Major priority, and; 11.88% with Minor priority.

#### 6.4.1. Lessons learned from Cycle 1
None of the teams met all of the TD payment goals established in Action 1. The main factor that influenced not meeting the goals was the prioritization being by quality rules priority, not taking into account the relevance of the source code for the project. This decision did not obtain a satisfactory result in the TD payment, as the teams reported that the criteria used to pay the TD did not consider the importance of the source code for the project. The developers had difficulty prioritizing the refactoring of source code that has low relevance for the system. Waste of effort was reported in the TD payment in source code that clients did not use or had not changed for last than two years. As this discovery happened through the developers' reports while monitoring the goals, the board decided to include this orientation for the next cycle.
The quality rules classified with Major priority significantly decreased in quantity, even though they were not part of the teams' goal. This happened since it was possible to use automated source code editor tools to help in refactoring these rules.
Due to the analysis of most PHP source code, an unexpected result of this project was the discovery of dead code, that is, source code that is not executed by any routine of the product and can be eliminated.
Another decision that did not obtain satisfactory results was the standardization of goals for all teams. This decision did not consider the efforts versus the team's resources and the criticality of the teams' projects. Thus, the teams did not prioritize the TD payment, justifying that they had more critical activities.
The results presented motivated the revision of the model for the next cycle. In the meetings to monitor the results of this project, held periodically with the leaders of each team, four results perceived by those responsible were highlighted:
1.	Changes in the culture of developers: Change in the behavior of developers, showing more significant concern in producing the artifacts with more quality and within the standards;
2.	Improvement in source code monitoring: TD monitoring allowed managers to monitor development more closely;
3.	Increased motivation of developers: The importance that was given by the area director in sponsoring the project motivated the teams in the behavior changes regarding product quality;
4.	The definition of goals should be aligned with the importance of the source code for the product: The information of the quality rules as the only criterion for prioritization caused much waste of resources and distrust of the effectiveness of the TD payment actions.
