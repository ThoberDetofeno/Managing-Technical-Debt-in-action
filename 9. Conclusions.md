## 9. Conclusions
This study was developed over approximately three years, in which a TDM process was designed, implemented, and incorporated into the software development process. Additionally, the TDM process was generalized to address all the main aspects of how TD should be managed. Although it had been applied to source code TD, it is not limited to managing this specific TD type. It can be tailored to handle different types of TD, such as documentation debt, test debt, and so forth.

The studies evaluated highlight the importance of context in TDM, but they did not consider context as an activity of the TDM process.This study, as a view in Fig. 4, added the Context activity as part of the process. The defining the Context helped in engagement the organization's sponsors and employees, guided action planning, and in the TD Prioritization

Three new activities were proposed for the management of TD:
- **Discovery**: The Discovery seeks to recognize the TD that are important to context. In this activity, the TD Guild participated in the choices of quality rules and tools that were aligned with TDM context;
- **Analysis**: The Analysis seeks to understand the causes and impacts of TD in the context of TDM. In this work, were created the guidelines for defining the Priority and the principal value of TD;
- **Review**: The periodically review enables continuous evolution of TDM, as occored in the second cycle where had a evolution of TDM.

This study presents KPI results, as resumed in **Table 3**, that **TDM has improved product external quality**. In evaluating the results of the second cycle, the KPI Value of Average Bugs Recorded per Customer shows better results than before the implementation of TDM. In addition, in practice, the procedures and guidelines used in conducting this study produced the following results: 
- Involvement of all stakeholders (e.g., technical team, business team, and managers) in decision making for TD payment;
- Ease of communication and monitoring of incurred TD;
- Industry application of the TD concept in a project with a large number of TDIs;
- Engagement of professionals in TDM by aligning expert opinions with the tools used;
- Alignment of expectations and goals from the definition of the context where the TDM was implemented; 
- Evidence that there was a reduction in the number of defects found by the customer, but the results are slow to appear in the product;
- Evidence that prevention actions (for example, documentation, standardization, training, and code review) effectively decrease the occurrence of new TDIs.

This process provides purposes and guidelines for managing TD. The application of these guidelines can be tailored for other organizations or contexts. Moreover, TDM aligned the strategic objectives with the teams' goals. Therefore, the TDM process proposed in this work provides a starting point for any organization to begin managing technical debt.

The TD Guild is a central part of the process, so our experience shows that selecting the right people for the guild is crucial to the succeed of the process. The lessons learned from the first cycle led us to allocate some of the most experienced developers to the guild in the second cycle.

As in Holvitie et al. (2018), this study also observed that agile practices and processes that verify and maintain the structure and clarity of artifacts (e.g., coding standards and refactoring practices) within software development projects are perceived to have a considerably positive effect on TDM [21]. And, like Falessi and Voegele (2015) [32], we identified that expert involvement increases teams' confidence in the TDM project. Our study also confirmed that the use of context-specific categorization increased developers' confidence in using SonarQube. Furthermore, we also identified that developers lack a prioritization mechanism to manage the various quality improvement opportunities offered by static source code analysis tools.

The TDM process developed in this study was extracted from TD's source code observations. The use of this process for other types of TDs was not in the scope of this research and was not investigated. Furthermore, given the context in which the research was carried out and the fact that it is an action-research project, its results are bound to a specific organizational context. It is possible that the defined activities defined can be applied to other software development organizations if their context variables are considered.

As it was not in the scope of this research to present a complete study of tools to support the implementation of TDM activities, since they depend on the technologies used by the companies, some quality rules suggested by the SonarQube tool may be questioned, as to the impact on the quality or on the productivity of the developers. However, it is believed that in this study, all selected rules contributed to the development within the standards and best practices proposed by the company. The effort and costs associated with implementing TDM were not recorded, and it is necessary to examine the impact of the process using alternative approaches such as quality, effort, and cycle time costs for management analysis.
