Guo and Seaman (2011) propose an initial TDM framework based on the portfolio approach, which core component is a technical debt list. The first step is identifying the TD. After, the fields on the TD list such as date, responsible person, type, location, and description can be filled out. The rest of the information, i.e., principal and interest estimates, will be obtained through measuring TD [27]. 

Letouzey and Ilkiewicz (2012) present the SQALE (Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations), which guides managing source code TD. The study contains recommendations for implementing a TDM process, but they do not address the TDM process as an all [28].

Oliveira, Goldman, and Santos (2015) implemented and evaluated the framework proposed by Carolyn Seaman and Yuepu Guo (2011) in two software companies adopting Scrum. The framework highlights the Identification, Measurement and Monitoring activities and more recent studies, as presented in [23], propose more activities and practices that should be incorporated in the management of TD.

In the research presented by Ramasubbu, Kemerer, and Woodard (2015), we highlight two findings: first, the importance of knowing the trade-offs involved in TDM, that is, the software teams need to clearly understand both the benefits and costs of TD in their business environment; and, a TD policy must be based on the business context and the technological environment in which the organization operates [3].

Falessi and Voegele (2015) report the experience of using quality rules in TDM, pointing out that the importance and negative impacts of quality rules may vary across contexts. The guidance provided by the authors was used in our study to support the revision of quality rules according to the organization's goals. We also used Falessi and Voegele's (2015) definition of quality rule as being “(…) an empirically validated software engineering principle dictating how the code should be.” [29].

Yli-Huumo, Maglyas, and Smolander (2016) showed a framework derived from 25 interviews performed in 8 software development teams to identify the processes, techniques, and tools used for TDM. Based on the eight TDM activities identified by Li et al. (2015) [30], the study presents a framework that explains the activities, practices/tools, stakeholders, and responsibilities of TDM. During the comparison of interviews, Yli-Huumo, Maglyas, and Smolander (2016) realized that there was a lot of variation in the TDM approaches and practices [31].

Inspired by risk management, Guo, Spínola, and Seaman (2016) proposed a TDM approach centered on a TD list. The TDM process consists of three general activities: TD Identification, TD Measurement, and TD Monitoring, which revolve around a TD list, the core component of the framework [14].

Rios et al. (2018) [23] conducted a tertiary study based on 13 secondary studies (systematic reviews and mappings). Regarding TDM, this tertiary study organized the topic scenario composed of activities, strategies, and management tools. Another contribution of this work is a synthesized and compiled list of implications for practitioners and researchers in the field, with evidence and suggestions of topics applicable in practice and where to find more details and information in Rios et al. (2021) [19]. The study [23] presents an overall picture of TD research, with gaps and implications for researchers on TDM. Among these gaps, some are aligned with our study, such as the need for a comprehensive TDM process, observing and applying TDM in the software industry, and increasing TD's visibility among developers and stakeholders.

Ramasubbu and Kemerer (2019) used the PMBOK organizing principle to develop a normative framework that integrates the PMBOK quality management processes with the processes required for TDM. The processes for TDM are divided into three major steps: Make TD visible, Perform cost-benefit analysis, and Control TD [32]. The process was implemented in three software development organizations. The framework presents difficulties in adapting to organizations with a lower level of maturity in quality management.

Although several theoretical and practical studies have been developed, there is still a need for new research that adapts the organizational context to TDM. A TDM process must adapt to changes in the organization's goals and software development processes. Furthermore, it was found that developed research presents several activities for TDM, but not all make clear in which order they should be performed.

The main characteristics of this study, which differentiate it from previous ones, are that the objectives of TDM are aligned with the organization's goals and TDM Process proposed has empirical evidence in a real-life software development environment.
