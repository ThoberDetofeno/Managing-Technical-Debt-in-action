## 7. Action Research Second Cycle
The second cycle of the action research followed the guidelines and lessons learned from the previous cycle. In this second cycle, the challenges were to implement standards and best practices of development and prioritize the TD in a more adherent way to the needs of the teams.

### 7.1. Data analysis
The main changes at this stage were in the TD Discovery and TD Measurement activities, where it was sought to understand better the quality rules and the impact on business objectives. This stage began with the revision of the TD Guild and the necessary tools for the project. The tasks of TD Discovery, TD Analysis, and TD Measurement were sequentially executed.

The revision of the TD Guild for this cycle followed the same guidelines and objectives of the previous cycle. Two members of the first cycle were kept in this group. Eight professionals made up the group: five experienced developers, two inspection and quality professionals, and one business professional. The changes in the TD Guild members aimed to improve developers' commitment and representativeness once they are the most affected by the project.

#### 7.1.1. TD Discovery 
The purpose of the TD Discovery is to recognize the TD type and the source code that are important to achieve the objectives. At this stage, the TD Guild aimed to know the new quality rules and their impacts on the company's goals. To do so, it sought to classify the quality rules into the known TD types.

Based on the knowledge acquired during the first cycle, the TD Guild decided to review the quality rules suggested by SonarQube. Thus, four members evaluated all the rules separately and presented the results to the TD Guild in a consensus meeting. At this meeting, it was decided to use 125 quality rules. Each quality rule was classified by TD type and by TD, as presented in Table 1. The 125 quality rules selected for this cycle were divided into Code, Defect, Design, and Documentation TD types.

In this cycle, the TD Guild increased the importance of the Documentation Debt and the violation of company standards. In the previous cycle, it was observed that these TD types help change the developers' culture.

#### 7.1.2. TD Analysis
This step followed the guidelines of the first cycle of classifying rules by priority, complexity, and impact criteria. Priorities were classified according to the feasibility of achieving the company's objectives and the resources available for the cycle. Below,  presents a list of priority options and a description to guide the ranking of the quality rules selected in the previous step:
-	**Blocker (33 rules)**: Items of these rules must be eliminated and will not be allowed to commit with items of these rules. Rules are considered bugs, system vulnerabilities, or commands that should not be used;
-	**Critical (19 rules)**: The number of items in these rules should be eliminated or decreased. Rules that the company understands are fundamental and have a high impact on product quality improvement and source code standardization;
-	**Major (34 rules)**: Rules of minor importance and impact on the improvement of the product quality. The development of new functionalities with these characteristics will not be allowed;
-	**Minor (39 rules)**: Rules of best practice that should be monitored but have little or no impact.

Four TD Guild members analyzed rules priority, following the guidelines described. After the analysis of the members, a consensus meeting was held with all the TD Guild participants.

To understand the feasibility of the actions, it is necessary to calculate the effort needed to solve each TD. The analysis of complexity, impact, and effort followed the guidelines of the first cycle. From these values, it was possible to calculate an estimate for the TD principal value used as a basis for the definition of TD payment actions.

#### 7.1.3. TD Measurement
In the TD Measurement step, the quality rules in the source code are executed, and the TDIs are identified. Each TDI represents a deviation from the standard set by the company. Table 1 shows the number of TDIs and the effort in minutes grouped by TD type and TD. It was noted that formatting and documentation represent 80.74% (Formatting pattern violation + Documentation Debt) of all the TDIs identified. However, proportionally, the Design Debt needs more effort to be resolved due to its complexity.

Table 1 shows the importance of analyzing TD by knowing the number of TDIs and the effort required to pay TD since the number of items does not proportionally represent the same effort to pay TD. For example, the "Formatting standard violation" has 61.19% of the total TDIs but corresponds to 4.48% of the required effort.

Number of rules and Items per TD.


Table 2 shows the number of TDIs per team and per priority. The Effort columns represent the number of minutes required to eliminate all the TDIs by priority.

### 7.2. Action planning
The TD Guild defined the actions and the TD Monitoring period (one year) at the planning stage. Based on the evaluation of the actions of the previous cycle and the data collection and analysis of this cycle, the TD Guild planned four steps:
1.	Prepare the goals per team for the TD payment, considering the source codes that have greater importance for the project or team.
2.	Define and communicate a PHP coding standard.
3.	Define and communicate a documentation pattern of the PHP source code.
4.	Communicate the project and the goals of each team by the board.

Every action had a TD Guild representative in charge. The person in charge of the action had the objective of ensuring the execution of the action and presenting the results to the stakeholders. The TD payment must rely on arguments that justify allocating resources to promote the change or refactoring the source code. The reasons used to prioritize the payment of TD in the first research cycle did not meet this need. In the second cycle, each team had to present a list of the most relevant source codes.

### 7.3. Implementation
#### 7.3.1. Action 1: Develop and monitor the goals for TD payment
The previous activities provided input for the teams to define TD payment actions. Therefore, the following criteria were agreed upon for the elaboration of the goals:
- Criterion 1: Each team must define a percentage reduction of the total TD.
- Criterion 2: Each team must provide a list of the most relevant source code for the team and propose the following actions: 
    - Refactor the source file;
    - Eliminate the TDIs;
    - Increase the coverage of automated testing; 
    - Increase the unit test coverage;
    - Document the source code.

Based on the criteria and suggestions, each team defined and sent the TD payment actions for the cycle period for board approval. The commitment signed between the team and the board of directors was linked to the team's performance indicators for evaluation in the company's profit-sharing program. It is possible that this affected the TD payment since it encouraged the teams to meet the targets for TD payment due to the rewards.

The TD Monitoring of the goals with the teams took place every two weeks. This action was carried out together with the follow-up meeting of the projects with the director of the area.

#### 7.3.2. Action 2: Define and communicate a coding standard
The primary function of defining development standards is to improve the ability of communication among developers so that there can be author changes of the source code with less disruption and keep the files more organized and straightforward to read and understand. The knowledge transfer was done through the standard documentation and two internal courses for developers. This action was executed in the first month of this second cycle.

#### 7.3.3. Action 3: Define and communicate the documentation standard of the source code
After implementing agile practices, source code documentation value started to be questioned. According to the developers' reports, especially the newly hired, it was evident that the current source code did not have a standard terminology that allowed a quick understanding. Another situation identified by the team was the difficulty of finding the routines already implemented in the system.

Similar to the previous action, the knowledge transfer was done through the new standard and developers' internal training. This action was executed in the first month of this second cycle.

#### 7.3.4. Action 4: Dissemination of the project by the board of directors
Communication by the board had a positive result in the first cycle, so this action was kept in this cycle. At the beginning of the cycle, the area director carried out the communication. He highlighted the project's importance and the teams' goals for year, along with the new rules to prioritize TD.

### 7.4. Evaluation
The guidelines of Rios et al. (2018) [23] helped in the initial definition of the development process of this cycle. From these studies, we used the activities of Identification, Measurement, Communication, Monitoring, Prioritization, and Payment. The evaluation of this cycle was divided into three phases, as following explained.

#### 7.4.1. First phase of evaluation
In this phase, the results were analyzed before starting the monitoring period of the TD's payment actions. Most of the activities performed followed the procedures of the previous cycle. Many of the practices and procedures performed in the previous cycle were repeated in this cycle, such as:
•	Creation of the TD Guild: the TD Guild played a crucial role in the TDM in both research cycles. The TD Guild was present in all management activities and was responsible for the creation of standards and the guidance to the teams;
•	Search of tools: in both research cycles, the tools made it possible to get to know part of the company's TD, and in this cycle, they helped in prioritization. Although not considered a management activity, the knowledge of the tools can be fundamental for the success of the TDM;
•	TD Measurement: in this activity, visibility is given to the TDIs and how much the TD is worth. The TD Measurement was essential to guide the decision making and the definition of actions for the control, elimination, or reduction of the TD;
•	Action to elaborate and follow up the goals: in both cycles, the teams present the goals to the board before the monitoring period;
•	Dissemination of the project by the board of directors: disseminating the project to all those involved was a practice that obtained results in the teams' engagement in the two cycles of the survey.

The activities TD Discovery and TD Analysis were suggested from the previous cycle's results. The Discovery activity was considered critical because an unidentified TD will not be part of the other project stages since this is not reviewed within the same cycle.

In the elaboration of the actions for the payment of the TD, some criteria were suggested to guide the teams in the definition of the goals. Each team chose the quantity and selected the source files they considered most relevant for the improvement actions, and the decisions were aligned with those responsible for the company. At the time of planning, the teams felt comfortable and confident in reaching the goals for the payment of TD in the cycle period.

#### 7.4.2. Second phase of evaluation
In the second phase of the evaluation, the data collected during the second cycle were analyzed. Periodic meetings were held to monitor the targets and KPIs. The team was responsible for TD Payment and TD Prevention activities. The TD Prevention was mainly performed in the code review activity before the task was done. The team leader was primarily responsible for prioritizing, monitoring the TD, and following up on the goals set for the team.

None of the teams finalized all the suggested actions. A total of 68.7% of the planned actions were concluded. However, when analyzing the results by priority the TDIs with Blocker and Major priority reached the goal, and the TDIs Critical and Minor decreased 15.36% and 13.13%, respectively. These results show that teams were concerned about paying for the TDIs. Still, the commitments with the delivery of new features and internal teams problems made it difficult to achieve all the established goals. 

Table 3 presents the results of the KPIs. Cycle one lasted from version 8 to version 11, and cycle two lasted from version 12 to version 16. Other versions are presented for longitudinal view purposes. Although these KPIs consider all company quality initiatives, there were no significant changes in the development process and project management during the entire study period, but the application of the TDM approach.

The analysis of the KPIs is per product version, so all customers must be using the version under study. This scenario is only possible after nine months of the released version since this is the time required for all customers to have updated the product to the latest versions.
Table 3
KPI results.

As shown in Table 3, it seems that the project may have had a negative impact on versions 15 and 16 due to the large number of changes made by the teams. However, after stabilizing the version, the company obtained significant positive results in versions 17 and 18. The evidence shows that the TDM improved the internal and external quality of the product. KPI2 (Average bugs per customer) showed positive results not previously achieved by the company since the beginning of the measurement of this KPI. 

One of the factors identified is that from the beginning of cycle one, the company increased ~22% in the customer portfolio and ~80% in total revenues. This represents that in this period, the company acquired more significant value contracts and customers with more intensive use of the product, i.e., the company had more intensive use of the product with more users. Still, the number of customers did not increase significantly (because a single customer may have unlimited users). This led the director to reflect on the results of these indicators as a measure for the strategic objectives.

In the follow-up meetings, the developers agreed that the project helped improve quality and that the current source code affects productivity and product quality. Currently, there is a lot of legacy source code developed under an architecture with several anomalies such as reuse difficulties, strong coupling, and lack of responsibility between the layers of architecture. Developers understand that it is necessary to evolve the source code by using new frameworks, improving development tools, and updating outdated code. TDM should evolve to architecture issues and bring visibility to structural product problems.

It was noted that developers have understood the impacts of TD and are concerned with refactoring the source code. Still, the requests to deliver new features, lack of resources, and the poor architecture of the source code, hindered the payment of TD.

#### 7.4.3. Third phase of evaluation
At this phase, the results and suggestions are due to a holistic analysis of the second cycle. All decisions were shared and approved after obtaining the consensus of those involved. This approach helped engage employees in the TDM. 

From the results, it was possible to observe that the formatting and documentation standards of the source code helped in the communication between developers and the search for functionalities already implemented in the system.

It was possible to validate the results on the quality of the product from the KPIs defined at the beginning of the project. However, it was identified that the measurement methods of the KPIs were not adherent to the company's growth. The management understands that there were significant positive results, and because of this, the project is in continuity and evolution.

In this cycle, the activities and operations carried out in the TDM became more evident. It was possible to describe a TDM process for the following years, mapping the following recommendations:
-	Conduct an annual review of TDM to evolve and maintain the best practices implemented.
-	Map the impacts on product functionality due to the changes in the source code because the results of the KPIs in versions 15 and 16 show evidence that the internal tests did not cover all functionalities impacted by the changes in the source code.
-	Use a method to prioritize the payment of the TD with more relevance to the project or teams.
-	Treat refactoring as an integral part of the software development process.
-	Promote continuous and incremental refactoring. Avoid great efforts in refactoring at once because the teams have several responsibilities and may not reach the expectations.
-	Develop design, code, and test guidelines for high-quality software.
-	Implement TD visualization tools at the time of coding.
-	Elaborate internal and external training programs in architecture and design to train developers and help introduce the culture of refactoring.
-	Incorporate the payment of TD as part of the Software Development process.
-	The company should move forward in identifying the vulnerability TD of the source code.
-	Continue to use the TDM process proposed.
